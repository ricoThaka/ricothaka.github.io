I want you to look at Atomic Red HEad post about the old [Uniroyal Tire Factory](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-30-me-5582-story.html). I need you to listen to her perspective.

> But why an Assyrian inspired design? There are two thoughts on that. One is in the name of the company itself, Samson. Samson was a character from the Bible and known for his strength. “There’s the idea about strength in tires, and that tires are the foundation for your car,” said Adrian Scott Fine of the Los Angeles Conservancy. Fine also pointed to the fact that King Sargon’s palace, Dur-Sharrukin, had been in the headlines earlier in 1928, as it was being excavated by American archaeologists. And some of the images on the company’s main building reflect those of King Sargon. King Sargon reigned from 721 B.C. to 705 B.C. in what is now Khorsabad, Iraq. </cite> - [AtomicRedHead.cOm](https://atomicredhead.com/2019/02/05/the-outlet-mall-masquerading-as-an-assyrian-palace/)

### A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States
## 1968: East Los Angeles Walkouts
Discrepancies in the education of Anglo and Mexican-American students surfaced in Los Angeles during the 1950s and 1960s. Mexican-American students experienced a 60% dropout rate from high school, and those who did graduate averaged the reading level of an 8th grade Anglo student. In some schools, teachers prohibited students from speaking Spanish, and in others, school staff recommended Mexican-American students educational curriculum meant to help students with mental disabilities. These schools funneled many Mexican American students into vocational programs and discouraged from post-secondary studies. In response, students, teachers, parents, and activists began to organize.[ContinueReading](https://guides.loc.gov/latinx-civil-rights/east-la-walkouts) [Related Tweet EastLosangeles Today](https://x.com/RicoThaka/status/1831786037527638408)

### Dear Rep/Mayor Karen,
I signed up for a class that [NASAJPL](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) is offering at [CourtYard by Marriot Pasadena](https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/courtyard-los-angeles-pasadena-monrovia.html). As you can see in the [LAPD DETAinMENT on METROLA PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricoThaka/ricothaka.github.io/pixelsquare/assets/pdf/image.pdf), I was accused of Tresspassing. I i dont know what i need to do to use the transit system safely. LAPD is pushing [FareEnforcement](https://abc7.com/post/metro-safety-stopping-fare-evaders-seen-key-preventing-crime/15054806/) but are not making exceptions. If you look at the graphic below in my [GMAiL_EMAiL_iNBOX](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXd4idMbwAUqOMQ?format=jpg&name=large) you will see that Los Angeles Police never emailed me back after i was victim of that Armed Gunman at CityHAll with the Playboy Backpack on, so this Tap card thing. I see people at Saint Francis with MailBoxes and There is this place in Santa Monica that offer mailboxes, but im in a different situation since i was Abandoned. I took a shower at [Reality_LA](https://realityla.com/), AND I KNOW The Medicated Shampoo and Terry Cloth towel Pulled out at least 200 bugs! The Larve breask my hair down and it just cracks off while Dry Scapl tortures me with itching and burning. Please send a team from NasaJPL to talk to them about what [Entomological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_warfare#:~:text=EW%20is%20a%20specific%20type,the%20insects%20over%20target%20areas.) looks like in [Los Angeles ](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA530979.pdf).

So I want to make sure i can make the [ECOSTRESS Science and Application Team Meeting - Fall 2024](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) meeting and start making more progress on getting my badge back.

Rep karen. My managers at nasajpl new that erika was not helping with childcare or food or the search for a house and i gut destituted! Since then she has been in porn and i dont know her psychological makeup. The Library System makes no attempts to work with me having no income. Can you help me openly network my team at nasajpl with the library and get my card clear for checking out books and a tech to go laptop. I have no communication. It makes Ted Ross look super stupid and possibly criminal # [SMART_LA](https://youtu.be/UzhxtDpYvoY?si=we3oE0ckHyw-PMmU)
>As of August 10, 2021, LA County Library has eliminated fines for overdue books and materials. As of this date, past, present, and future overdue fines for materials will no longer be charged. The burden of administrative fines and fees can create financial strain for low-income families and can contribute to a cycle of economic hardship. Recent actions statewide have brought to light the concept that administrative fees can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable individuals, particularly youth, non-citizens, and people of color. For these reasons, more and many libraries around the country—and the world—are eliminating fines. LA County Library is happy to be a new member of fine free libraries.

### [The impact of COVID19 pandemic and government enforced lockdowns on levels of attendance and context of sexual assaults reported at Saint Marys Sexual Assault Referral Centre pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10245237/pdf/main.pdf)

[Intimate partner violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10245237/#:~:text=Reports%20of%20intimate%20partner%20violence,in%20Peru%20increased%20by%2048%25) (IPV) is usually experienced by women by their partners and can take many forms including physical and sexual violence.30 Reports of intimate partner violence have increased at varying rates internationally during lockdowns in 2020 compared to the same months in 2019: there was a 23% increase of sexual and psychological violence reported in a survey of 13,786 people in Spain4; calls to a domestic violence helpline in Peru increased by 48%5; emergency calls from women about domestic violence in European Union States increased by 60%6 and domestic violence calls in the United States of America increased by 7.5%.7 Lockdown and economic stress as a result of COVID-19 has been attributed to the increase in IPV, lockdown in particular is considered to have increased incidences of psychological, physical and sexual abuse.4 Although lockdown measures may be temporary, the economic and financial stress felt because of the pandemic are likely to be long lasting and thus physical and sexual abuse increases are likely to have long-term impacts on individuals and services. These increases in IPV across the world highlight the need for services offering support to consider their current delivery to ensure all victims are supported in both the short- and long-term.
