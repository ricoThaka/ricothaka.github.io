## X-Men - Children Of The Atom (950105 USA)
X-Men: Children of the Atom (Japanese: エックス・メン　チルドレン　オブ　ジ　アトム, Hepburn: Ekkusu Men Chirudoren obu ji Atomu) is an arcade game that was produced by Capcom and released on the CP System II arcade hardware in 1994 in Japan and in 1995 in North America and Europe.

Based on the X-Men comic book, it is the first fighting game produced by Capcom using characters under license from Marvel Comics. Released around the time of the mid-1990s X-Men animated series, the game features voice actors from the series reprising their roles. The game's plot is based on the "Fatal Attractions" story from the comics – players control one of the X-Men or their enemies in their fight against the villain Magneto. They face each of the other characters in the game in best of three one-on-one fighting matches, before battling Juggernaut and Magneto.

The gameplay has much in common with Capcom's previous fighting games, Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Darkstalkers. Children of the Atom adds a combo system that features long combos that can even be performed in mid-air. Also featured in the game are various tactical maneuvers, including the ability for characters to roll. Children of the Atom introduced multi-tiered fighting environments in which the ground would crumble and characters would fall into lower parts of the level. These concepts and the fast pace of the game would provide the basis for Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom series, which started with the game's successor X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

Ports of the game were released for Sega Saturn, PlayStation and personal computer. Of these, the PlayStation version was not as well received as the other versions, suffering from slowdown and missing frames of animation.

### [The Global CTX Mosaic of Mars](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/index.html)

The Bruce Murray Laboratory for Planetary Visualization has completed a 5.7 terapixel mosaic of the surface of Mars rendered at 5.0 m/px. Each pixel in the mosaic is about the size of a typical parking space, providing unprecedented resolution of the martian surface at the global scale.

We emphasize transparency both in how the mosaic was generated and for users to understand where data in the mosaic come from. We have developed a Python-based pipeline that incorporates non-destructive image processing techniques that preserve all information about the original data that comprise the mosaic and map all seams..

### Excerpt from Genesis Game Guide by The Scribe
Sega's in-house pro football sim - a YACEG series that
                  went with Joe Montana as its spokesman until the 1996
                  release, when the decision was made to use Deion Sanders
                  instead.  The second, NFL Sportstalk Football, was the
                  very first videogame to feature a running commentary, and
                  was the subject of a special feature on the British
                  television program Tomorrow's World. [Read_More](http://backup.segakore.fr/genesiscollective/ShowPage00000000028B686721.htm)

Fred makes arrangements for Pebbles’ first birthday and the Water Buffalo Lodge parties. Trouble ensues when the only caterer in town muddles the parties, including sending a children’s clown to the Water Buffalo Lodge and dancing girls to the babies’ party, and Fred gets blamed for it. Teaser is again a scene from the middle of the episode. [B98tv CArtoons](https://www.b98.tv/video/pebbles-birthday-party)

## [ABC Network](https://abc.com/) - The Flintstones - "Fred's Flying Lesson" (Promo, 1965)
Here (from an original 2" Quad tape) is a promo for The Flintstones episode "Fred's Flying Lesson," to air at 7:30pm (6:30pm Central time).

This promo starts with a "swinging" RCA TK-60 black-and-white camera with an 'abc' sticker on the side (this was their ID between 1964 and 1966). Also, although this promo was in black-and-white, The Flintstones itself aired in color by this point on the network (one of the very few prior to their increasing color programming in the 1965-66 season).

Ending voiceover by ??

This promo aired on local Chicago TV on Friday, January 1st 1965 at about 6:29pm.

## [Dear_Cardi](https://www.cardibofficial.com/)
I dont know if you are Bia but i like the song fallback and i was wondering if its you. anyway i found a [Street Fighter 3 Strategy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISOoypQTO2M) im scared to ebed the thing bc webpages foded with incoming content from another place is a security hole and ppl slow down the website. Do you remember [TeeShirt](https://linktr.ee/thetshirtlady) in the villiage ? [The_Tshirt_Lady](https://thetshirtlady.com/) i never really made it back to EastATL after Erika got kidnapped, it was a nightmare caring for coral! Like now that i know [MagicCity staff](https://www.magiccity.com/) is working at [DFCS](https://dfcs.georgia.gov/) im trying to figure out where my bullying began bc even with the vibrator story Manessa is [Janika Lashae](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11743788/) and wrote down the vibrator was non sexual in use. An she was cutting me off talking about i am always saying innaporpriate things. She formed a physical relationship with me i need to resolve bc its distracting... I am really confused physically bc all the names you guys use to navigate sex tourism... [Normani is on the street man](https://x.com/MooNLOVER404/status/1714401375726219655) I found her in this [Los Angeles HoStroll](https://youtu.be/jUnxQNFSeHA?si=T0vsGpLwIcNrWEtQ) TTyl soon pages will be like [GeoCities](https://www.reddit.com/r/forgottenwebsites/comments/r2icam/a_collection_of_old_geocities_websites_1990s2000s/) research hotlinking for your business growth. i hope that dont get me arrested im in an active twitter exchange with [the secratary of defense](https://www.defense.gov/About/Secretary-of-Defense/), [NasaJPl](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/virtual-tour/), [LA_City_council](https://lacity.gov/government/elected-officials/city-council) and [Karen Bass](https://www.congress.gov/member/karen-bass/B001270?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22karen+bass%22%7D&s=1&r=1)! She is a [Congressmember](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) that looks after our district in addition to being mayor so i dont know who have more responsibility but [Senator Bill](https://www.nasa.gov/people/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson/) that is responsible for [Nasa](https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=nasa+news&FORM=HDRSC7) may be her peer, what is a Rep vs a Senator? 

[American Government 101: Difference Between House and Senate](https://online.maryville.edu/blog/difference-between-house-and-senate/#article1)
[The Legislative Branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-legislative-branch/) Last thing, how is the little girl? you know coral is an ivf baby so i wonder if her mom is fighting rn bc [Reproductive health care](https://reproductiverights.gov/) is big news right now

Education for Death: The Making of the Nazi is an American animated propaganda short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released on January 15, 1943, by RKO Radio Pictures, shown in theaters with Fighting Frontier. The film is directed by Clyde Geronimi and principally animated by Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Frank Thomas, and Bill Tytla.[2] The short is based on the non-fiction book of the same name[3] by American author Gregor Ziemer. The film features the story of Hans, a boy born and raised in Nazi Germany, his indoctrination in the Hitlerjugend, and his eventual march to war. - [ReadMoreOnWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_for_Death) [ReadMoreOnIMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035836/) [cspan](https://www.c-span.org/video/?464005-2/education-death)

## The Vanishing Private
The war continues in the 1942 [Disney_Shorts](https://www.disneyplus.com/editorial/shorts) with one of my absolute favorites – The Vanishing Private. Donald Duck, who normally plays the role of frustrated working man, gets an upgrade to be the antagonist of this short, playing off of Pete. And he does it all while enlisted in the Army, as we saw in Donald Gets Drafted. - [ReadMorE](http://www.disneyfilmproject.com/2010/09/vanishing-private.html) - [disneyfilmproject](http://www.disneyfilmproject.com/)

[Donald_Fauntleroy_Duck](https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/stories/donald-duck-american-diplomat) is an American cartoon character from The Walt Disney Company. Donald is a white anthropomorphic duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He usually wears a sailor shirt, cap, and a red bow tie, but no trousers. Donald’s most famous personality trait is his easily provoked and explosive temper. Donald Duck has been officially honored as the third most popular cartoon character of all time with Bugs Bunny of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies at number two and fellow Disney creation Mickey Mouse who is number one.

# Marvel Super Heroes 1967
In 1966, Marvel Comics hired animation company Grantray-Laurence to create "The Marvel Superheroes", a series of daily cartoons based on their titles Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and the Sub-Mariner. As it was Marvel's first foray into television animation, the producers stretched out the budget by using existing stories and artwork. Original comic art pages were Xeroxed and used as key frames, with animators adding only mouth and limb animation. Body movement was often accomplished by animating still images across a background. 

Fortunately for comic fans, this cost-cutting move preserved for all time the original artwork of Gene Colon, Don Heck, and Jack "King" Kirby, and the dialog of Stan Lee. It was exactly what readers have always asked TV and movie makers to do: just film the comics.

Hi KK if thats you, Sharon sister. Eitherway i think you are an awesome Mayor, I was told taht since you in Congress you can fire me... anyway! Can you flip through these images when you get a chance its some important documents like the LA County excerpt on what the [Mayor](#Mayor)'s Jobrole is and her Hiring and Firing abilities. The CoronaVirus Patent from Emeryville's Chiron Corp is also there. Thats where i married Erika, Alameda County and i did not know she had a past in Prositituibn. Baptism washes away all the sins... I never thought id be a victim! [LaReina](https://archive.org/details/lareinalosangele00hill) is a book of Losangles history, but it starts in 1929 it was written by a financial institution and it omits the presence of Agriculture, like the Citrus groves of beverlyhills! The Egyptian, that theater in hollywood, there is a shop across the street [Abyssinia Gifts from Africa](https://hollywoodpartnership.com/go/abyssinia-gifts-from-africa) that has a ton of architechtual clues to the takeover. Longs Peir was destroyed and others along the coast and history is constantly blotted out after sex parties! I put the Kingdom Hall in Avondale Estates up bc i knew a lot of women from there and Erika as well and I have to be prepared bc The Quran is their native book and after Sex trafficking folds i can expect 3-5 brides at once and i dont know what to do bc im being tortured for just knowing them and we are constantly growing in similar dierctions and need freedom to talk without being poisoned and stalked

Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island[a] is a 1995 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It is the sequel follow-up to Super Mario World. The player controls Yoshi, a friendly dinosaur, on a quest to reunite baby Mario with his brother Luigi, who has been kidnapped by Kamek. As a Super Mario series platformer, Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items with Mario's help. The game has a hand-drawn aesthetic and was the first in the franchise to have Yoshi as its main character, where it introduces his signature flutter jump and egg spawning abilities
After four years of development, Yoshi's Island was released in Japan in August 1995 and worldwide two months later....[ReadMore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_Island) src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_Island [SuperMarioWiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_World_2:_Yoshi%27s_Island) [YoshiWiki](https://yoshi.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Mario_World_2:_Yoshi%27s_Island) [Play](https://www.smbgames.be/mario-world-2-yoshis-island.php) [Play](https://www.retrogames.onl/2017/03/super-mario-world-2-snes.html)

In the 1870s, French-born and -trained artist Jules Tavernier settled in San Francisco, where he received his most important commission from Tiburcio Parrott, the city’s leading banker. During an 1876 visit from his Parisian business partner Baron Edmond de Rothschild and the baron’s traveling companion Count Gabriel Louis de Turenne, Parrott was able to obtain entry to a ceremonial dance of the Elem Pomo known as the mfom Xe (people dance) in an underground Xe-xwan (roundhouse) at Clear Lake, California. -

  This is a doc­u­ment I cre­ated to share with my cowork­ers how I have been cre­at­ing and man­ag­ing my duties to build LDOMS. If you have not heard, LDoms or as they are now know as Ora­cle VM Server for SPARC is a fan­tas­tic hyper­vi­sor tech­nol­ogy that allows the user to par­ti­tion a mul­ti­core sparc based server into a bunch of lit­tle servers :) . One thing to be cau­tious of is assign­ing an uneven num­ber of cores to an LDom this can cause an LDom to per­form very badly in some cases.

—–
{% highlight ruby %} 
Build­ing LDOMS and pro­vi­sion­ing storage

A pre­req­ui­site of build­ing out LDOMS is to make sure the server is at the lat­est ver­sion of its firmware, Ldom soft­ware is installed and a cur­rent match­ing ver­sion of Ora­cle Solaris is being used on guest and host.

Below is a list­ing of a sta­ble ldom platform

Firmware

T5140 OBP 4.32.2 2010/​10/​29 15:36

T5120 OBP 4.32.2.b 2010/​12/​21 20:20

OS ver­sion

Ora­cle Solaris 10 9/​10 s10s_​u9wos_​14a SPARC

Vir­tu­al­iza­tion Platform

Ora­cle VM Server for SPARC (2.0 release)

Ver­sion 2.1 is avail­able and should go into test­ing as soon as all ldom host are updated to the base­line I have set. You can down­load it here

http://​www​.ora​cle​.com/​t​e​c​h​n​e​t​w​o​r​k​/​s​e​r​v​e​r​-​s​t​o​r​a​g​e​/​v​m​/​d​o​w​n​l​o​a​d​s​/​i​n​d​e​x​.​h​t​m​l​?​s​s​S​o​u​r​c​e​S​i​t​e​I​d​=​o​c​o​men

after installing make sure ser­vice svc:/ldoms/ldmd:default is run­ning.

Lat­est patch bundle

/​manna/​Solaris10-​​Supplies/​MAR112011

Now that the envi­ron­ment is in place. Net­work­ing must be setup for the phys­i­cal por­tion of the instal­la­tion. The T5120/​40s both con­tain 4 net­work ports. These can be used for NIC team­ing to improve through­put and per­for­mance, they can also be assigned to indi­vid­ual domains, and lastly you can route all traf­fic through a sin­gle NIC.

Now that we have net­work­ing the next area of con­cern is stor­age. Cur­rently (6/​27/​2011) all fiber con­nected nodes are con­nected to the fab­ric via Qlogic 23xx series HBAs. The dri­vers are built into recent ver­sions of Solaris. To pro­vi­sion stor­age for LDOMS sim­ply apply the cor­rect zon­ing within the cisco fab­ric man­ager. An instance can be found at fiber​man​.core​.gtri​.org. This is a win­dows 2008 server. Use the pass­word for Cassini-​​a to start it up which can be found in Nova.

After stor­age has been pro­vi­sioned. We have to approach the choice of how to han­dle the stor­age.

A: Allow the host to man­age the zvols for the guest.

B: Directly attach luns to guest for guest to management.

The method I have found effec­tive to man­age these things and make them easy to move is to allow the host to man­age all stor­age for the guest as in this example

 

NAME VOLUME OPTIONS MPGROUP DEVICE

primary-​​vds1 

regor-​​boot /​dev/​zvol/​dsk/​LDOM-​​regor/​boot_​vol

regor-​​3 /​dev/​zvol/​dsk/​Regor-​​DB-​​Pool/​regor3 

regor-​​2 /​dev/​zvol/​dsk/​Regor-​​DB-​​Pool/​regor2

regor-​​redo2 /​dev/​zvol/​dsk/​Regor-​​Redo2-​​Pool/​regor-​​redo2 

The vol­umes are all ZFS filesys­tems man­aged by the host. The way to pro­vi­sion space on the host to be exported to the guest is to first cre­ate a pool

zpool cre­ate LDOM-​​ixion c2t207000C0FFD82697d233 

Then cre­ate a dataset within the pool

zfs cre­ate –V 57G LDOM-​​ixion/​ixion_​boot

The –V option spec­i­fies the size. You need to do this to be able to use the allo­cated stor­age on the guest.

Note the pools on this host

Pools with the LDOM pre­fix indi­cate that the boot disk is con­tained here. When on any host {hostname}_zpool is always the root par­ti­tion this makes it easy to iden­tify when writ­ing scripts The other pools are for the guest resid­ing within the host. Some instal­la­tions such as that of ora­cle require mul­ti­ple pools. It is also easy enough to allo­cate stor­age and attach it directly to the guest as men­tioned before.

To attach a zvol to a guest

ldm add-​​vdsdev /​dev/​zvol/​dsk/​LDOM-​​ixion/​ixion_​boot host­name–boot@vds–host­name

To add a raw lun

ldm add-​​vdsdev /​dev/​dsk/​c3t5000402101F45935d86s2 hostname-redo1@vds-hostname

here are the basic com­mands to build an LDOM

Primary is typ­i­cally your con­trol domain and will take care of all other LDOMS.

Now it’s time to install Vir­tual I/​O to pri­mary con­trol domain.

Vir­tual ser­vice for disk server — ldm add-​​vds vds-​​ldomname primary
Vir­tual net­work ter­mi­nal server — ldm add-​​vcc port-range=5000–5006  vcc-​​console pri­mary The amount is really depen­dant on how many LDoms you plan to pro­vi­sion
Vir­tual ser­vice for net­work switch — ldm add-​​vsw net-dev=nxge0 sub-​​20 primary
Ver­ify what you did — ldm list-​​services
Pri­mary by default has all of the server’s resources, to allo­cate some to it and free oth­ers for guest Ldoms use the com­mands below.

Cryp­to­graphic engine — ldm set-​​mau N primary
Vir­tual CPU — ldm set-​​vcpu N pri­mary (Note two vcpus should be given to the pri­mary domain and the remain­ing vcpus should be divided among the amount of LDoms you want the sys­tem to host. In best prac­tice LDom amount should be lim­ited to the amount of MAUs avail­able)
Mem­ory — ldm set-​​memory N(G,M) pri­mary mem­ory can be issued in Gigs or megs if you need to get really specific
All this make pri­mary to be in delayed con­fig­u­ra­tion, so save con­fig­u­ra­tion first and poweroff/​poweron.

Check con­fig­u­ra­tion — ldm list-​​spconfig
Add con­fig­u­ra­tion — ldm add-​​spconfig name —— IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOU WILL REGRET IT! When the sys­tem is pow­ered off it will lose all of the con­fig that you have worked so hard to plan and implement.
ver­ify resources are allo­cated to pri­mary — ldm list
Power off — init 0 
One note here — “init 5” behaives as “init 6”, strange. So I “init 0” and from ALOM do poweroff
To cre­ate a Guest domain

Cre­ate guest LDom — ldm add-​​domain ${LDOM}

Add vcpu — ldm add-​​vcpu 16 ${LDOM}
Add RAM — ldm add-​​memory 8g ${LDOM}
Add MAU — ldm add-​​mau 2 ${LDOM}
Add vir­tual net­work device on net switch — ldm add-​​vnet vnet0 ${NET} ${LDOM}
Add vir­tual disk DEVICE to be sys­tem disk for LDom– ldm add-​​vdsdev /dev/zvol/dsk/${SPACE}/${LDOM} zdisk@vds-${LDOM}
Add vir­tual DISK — ldm add-​​vdisk zdisk0 zdisk@vds-${LDOM} ${LDOM}
Set auto­boot to false — ldm set-​​variable auto-boot\?=false ${LDOM}
Point to vir­tual disk device as boot device — ldm set-​​variable boot-device=/virtual-devices@100/channel-devices@200/disk@0 ${LDOM}
Bind LDom — ldm bind-​​domain ${LDOM}
Start LDom — ldm start-​​domain ${LDOM}
Now that the LDOM is cre­ated you still need an OS. Jump­start­ing is an option but there is no work­ing jump­start server currently.

Stop and unbind the domain

Add the vir­tual disk service

ldm add-​​vdiskserverdevice /export/home/rkelly3/sol-10-u9-ga-sparc-dvd.iso iso@vds-hostname

ldm add-​​vdisk iso iso@vds-hostname LDOMname

Now bind and start the new domain:

# ldm bind-​​domain LDOM­name
# ldm start-​​domain LDOM­name
LDom LDOM­name started

# tel­net local­host 5001

Try­ing 127.0.0.1…
Con­nected to local­host.
Escape char­ac­ter is ‘^]’.

12፤ ከዚያም ሉልና የከበረ ድንጋይ ይገኛል።

13፤ የሁለተኛውም ወንዝ ስም ግዮን ነው፤ እርሱም የኢትዮጵያን ምድር ሁሉ ይከብባል።

14፤ የሦስተኛውም ወንዝ ስም ጤግሮስ ነው፤ እርሱም በአሦር ምሥራቅ የሚሄድ ነው።

15፤ አራተኛውም ወንዝ ኤፍራጥስ ነው። እግዚአብሔር አምላክም ሰውን ወስዶ ያበጃትም ይጠብቃትም ዘንድ በዔድን ገነት አኖረው።

16፤ እግዚአብሔር አምላክም ሰውን እንዲህ ብሎ አዘዘው። ከገነት ዛፍ ሁሉ ትበላለህ፤

17፤ ነገር ግን መልካምንና ክፉን ከሚያስታውቀው ዛፍ አትብላ፤ ከእርሱ በበላህ ቀን ሞትን ትሞታለህና።

18፤ እግዚአብሔር አምላክም አለ። ሰው ብቻውን ይሆን ዘንድ መልካም አይደለም፤ የሚመቸውን ረዳት እንፍጠርለት።

19፤ እግዚአብሔር አምላክም የምድር አራዊትንና የሰማይ ወፎችን ሁሉ ከመሬት አደረገ፤ በምን ስም እንደሚጠራቸውም ያይ ዘንድ ወደ አዳም አመጣቸው፤ አዳምም ሕያው ነፍስ ላለው ሁሉ በስሙ እንደ ጠራው ስሙ ያው ሆነ።

20፤ አዳምም ለእንስሳት ሁሉ፥ ለሰማይ ወፎችም ሁሉ፥ ለምድር አራዊትም ሁሉ ስም አወጣላቸው፤ ነገር ግን ለአዳም እንደ እርሱ ያለ ረዳት አልተገኘለትም ነበር።

21፤ እግዚአብሔር አምላክም በአዳም ከባድ እንቅልፍን ጣለበት፥ አንቀላፋም፤ ከጎኑም አንዲት አጥንትን ወስዶ ስፍራውን በሥጋ ዘጋው።

22፤ እግዚአብሔር አምላክም ከአዳም የወሰዳትን አጥንት ሴት አድርጎ ሠራት፤ ወደ አዳምም አመጣት።

23፤ አዳምም አለ። ይህች አጥንት ከአጥንቴ ናት፥ ሥጋም ከሥጋዬ ናት፤ እርስዋ ከወንድ ተገኝታለችና ሴት ትባል።

24፤ ስለዚህ ሰው አባቱንና እናቱን ይተዋል፥ በሚስቱም ይጣበቃል፤ ሁለቱም አንድ ሥጋ ይሆናሉ።

25፤ አዳምና ሚስቱ ሁለቱም ዕራቁታቸውን ነበሩ፥ አይተፋፈሩም ነበር።</p>

# Clean WordPress URLS

Don’t you think its fun to add a new tool to your tool box no mat­ter how small it may seem? Well I sim­ply love my sexy new URLs. My links look so much bet­ter. Most impor­tantly it helps peo­ple get a pre­view with­out actu­ally view­ing the page. It also helps search engines index your con­tent. This is how my links used to look…

```
http://funkysite.com/?p=4974
```

Now you see the post title or page name in the URL. Tech­ni­cal peo­ple refer to them as ‘SLUGS’. Not the lit­tle shell-​​less snail-​​like crea­tures that come out at night. No, slugs are reader friendly ver­sions of URLs. In them the date, post name, cat­e­gory etc can be cus­tomized to be placed inside your URL struc­ture. It is very impor­tant for any small busi­ness web­site. It really sep­a­rates you from peo­ple that are just toss­ing up a site to make a few quick bucks. So many lit­tle things to note when putting a busi­ness up on the web. Not to men­tion the fact that slugs affect your page rank and peo­ples desire to inves­ti­gate your care­fully writ­ten page. What would you click first if you were search­ing for recipes to cook beans and rice?



## | ```http://funkysite.com/?p=4974```        |   OR  | ```http://funkysite.com/food/Beans-and-Rice ?``` |
 



Basi­cally all that has to be done is to change the perma­link appear­ance inside of word­press to cus­tom stuc­ture. I sim­ply used /%postname%/ for mine and then mod­i­fied the .htac­cess file to read as follows

### BEGIN WordPress

> RewriteEngine On
> RewriteBase /
> RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
> RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
> RewriteRule . /index.php [L]

 

### END WordPress

That called the apache mod_​rewrite to clean up the appear­ance of the URLs. Hope you find this useful

Hi Jamie/Robin/Brenda
  During my last time with you on campus i was told to explore the wheels! I guess you guys Saw my research to build a high powered grocery getter. I found this hole in the wheel about two months ago. The girls are really going through it right now and I really dont know what the future holds, but im dedicated to the mission. Jose Pi did not know i was real. I slap myself for running off when he said you cant come back. I learned a lot about working remote in Atlanta but i got fired twice bc i was having too much fun! I was completing tasks and training thier employees! PearsonEdu had a bunch of Windows admins and i tought them a lot of LinuxBased #DNS philosophy next thing you know im working remote and i have no income! If you are not in a office position ppl stop trusting you. I never knew my coworkeds went to MagicCity its a dark neighborhood secret and as we got older i aged out of the computer world in the east bc Normani got famous in BallroomDanceing and numbed the sex servant side to the eyes of the Public. Once i was seen with her it got really hard at work, I had no idea so much sabotage exisited. We got involved also be i was working 24.7 oncall "MissionCritical" support for Web.com and Ionic Security i saved them from Splunk issues so many times at night. I understand sleepcycles bc she became my friend. Im OnCall for them so "Be oncall for me" It was a freindship gesture. Now im friends with a sex slave, thats attracted to me!

## Rape

[![homepage](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Comprehensive_Scale_of_Rape_%282018%29_-_LRW-SCALE-11.svg)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Comprehensive_Scale_of_Rape_%282018%29_-_LRW-SCALE-11.svg "Redirect to homepage")

<span class="firstcharacter"> Rape is a</span> type of sexual assault involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without their consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent.[1][2] The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.

## Wartime Sexual Violence

<a href="https://16days.thepixelproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/War-rape.jpg"> <img src="https://16days.thepixelproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/War-rape.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;" align="right" alt="Pineapple" /> </a>

Wartime sexual violence is rape or other forms of sexual violence committed by combatants during armed conflict, war, or military occupation often as spoils of war, but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. A war crime, it is distinguished from sexual harassment, sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service.[1][2][3]
During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. Wartime sexual violence may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalized sexual slavery, wartime sexual violence associated with specific battles or massacres, as well as individual or isolated acts of sexual violence.
Rape can also be recognized as genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. International legal instruments for prosecuting perpetrators for genocide were developed in the 1990s, with the Akayesu case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda being widely considered as a precedent.[4] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.

## Definition of wartime sexual violence
 # Main article:
 Rape There is no consensus definition of wartime sexual violence, as there is variance in what forms of violence are included in the definition and variance in which violence is considered conflict-related.[5] The terms rape, sexual assault and sexual violence are frequently used interchangeably.[6] The Explanatory Note of the Rome Statute, which binds the International Criminal Court, defines rape as follows:  The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.[7] and The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a person incapable of giving genuine consent.[7] The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.[8] A prominent data-set on conflict-related sexual violence, Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict (SVAC), builds on the ICC definition and covers seven forms of violence: "(a) rape, (b) sexual slavery, (c) forced prostitution, (d) forced pregnancy, (e) forced sterilization/abortion, (f) sexual mutilation, and (g) sexual torture."[5] The data-set defines conflict-related sexual violence as the sexual violence committed "armed actors (specifically, state militaries, rebel groups, and progovernment militias) during periods of conflict or immediately postconflict," thus excluding sexual violence by civilians.[5] More expansive definitions may define wartime sexual violence as being committed even by civilians if the conflict creates a sense of impunity.[5]

# UnixinG_Android 
Hi MRO, want you to have an update on what my computing situation has been since Jose took my laptop back. Im in the library system but they wont let me have free access to a computer. Its connected to my spouse's prostitution and porno. In [Santa Monica Porn is filmed at the library at times](https://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/pornhub-movie-filmed-at-public-library-angers-neighbours/news-story/8f4387f7d47490bba31bd28ac27994d8). The security gaurds told me I need an ID to come in! This is the [Santa Monica Public Library](https://smpl.org/)! and the resulting gossip among security gaurds about me having #Normani_aka_SartuAdem nudes on my cellphone! It was a gift! Im grown and i did not do it on library wifi! There is a law on it i found online. Its filtered now, but i want to know where i stand bc I was attending a dance studio with girls my age and i have been in datacenters most of my life, porn is the channel most ppl in my demographic communicate via to talk to people in the physical world. It causes a lot of hormonal problems and i am a really healthy male. Coral is strong even after the NiCU. Anyway the computers i had accquired got stolen in various ways so there is a big chunck of time i am not building on a Desktop. I promised I would grow as a Sun Admin and while i was without a computer i got turned on to [TErmux](https://termux.dev/en/) and leared a lot of cool configurations to do common programming tasks and it even effected my webdesign, i started building on github and what is now my homepage was a fullpage scrolling design like i was seeing life differently. Check out the screenshots below the Termux demo and see my #PocketPC thats what i call [Android](https://www.android.com/) now...

I listened to [Ctrl](https://www.essence.com/entertainment/only-essence/sza-ctrl-essay/) and understand a lot more about black adolescent emotions, i saw u in [Hollywood](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory), after looking past the grey i realize im not that old! I dont know what i told you in Atlanta, but im not a person to leave loose strings, i may not even be important enough to you to be mentioned. Either way, i asked you for girlfriend advice and your album delivered again, thanks. im more at peace being single(ish) I dont want to talk about Normani bc im still scared thats you, i had a bedroom bandit that was going to the studio, she bonded like a step mother and coral would continue sleeping whenever she came over, or she put yquil in her lunch at Parkside. I was not given foodstamps back then so me an coral got skinny, so i may have all these relationships in my head with the pretty girls from up the street. At the very least im your fan...

I have not really connected to any of your songs before, but today is different. I miss riding in [Savannah](https://visitsavannah.com/). I lost my little girl, the one that was with me when you an your girl pulled up on me in Savannah. That song was really healing. Im in Los Angeles, i got intimate with [Normani](https://variety.com/2024/music/news/normani-dopamine-debut-solo-album-1235918512/) and i dont know what life is, but i saw that LenoxMall tape when [Allied](https://www.aus.com/) tried you. They had this Intership program at Dance411 an a few girls encircled me, we went to Graveyard and HodgePodge for meetings, an after some reondevus with about 4 different girls that all wear the same makeup i realized i got played... There is this lightskinone i see in Hollywood hellafly, used to dance there... Anyway Im running bc i was accused of killing erika and ppl trying to kill me bc the charge cant stick! [Nasa](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) has been monitoring me an i know i can get clear! If you stuck in LosAngeles go get a BackgroundCheck its [FortMcFphereson](https://militarybases.com/georgia/fort-mcpherson/) for LA bc im getting taht since im criminally clean they putting a lot of pressure on me to stay healthy so they can come home. Erika is [Latto](https://www.essence.com/celebrity/mulatto-rapper/) her an Gucci was ... actually u know all there was a [namechange](https://www.11alive.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/the-a-scene/why-rapper-mulatto-changed-her-name/85-2e9c3a1c-0d0f-4ea3-9589-91ded4a60165) an im hurt but since Matt is involved i hope there was like a bad trick bc, at somepoint hey will be free from Playboy an im grieving Normani getting shit Erika missed out on bc they would never give her privacy as a married woman. Its Genocide man they have a word for it in California... [eugenics](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-07-07/caltech-robert-millikan-eugenics-sterilization)
