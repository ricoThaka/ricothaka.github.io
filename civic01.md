# About Kash Doll and Me
NasaJPL, I dont know what she is going by at the moment but she is my post erika wife forever girlfriend surrounding that. The name I was given origionally was Vanessa Walker. We were little kids here from africa that got kidnapped and moved east. She is still in some sort of human trafficking situation. To me she is a really important person and as some of you know my energy towards those in [UpperUnix] administration know how i look up to you. Its isolated bc im learning from you. She is similar. But she has a lot of identities and worst case I want you guys to know i never did any fruad with her. But know thats whats required of her. The character Normani, looks like an attempt for the girls to substitute for each other bc i still get her confused with Erika when she has the [LightComplexion](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5aac18d09fe2d82be24601a8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Brat%20Mail%20Kash%20Doll.jpg) bc they share similar features. Im also afraid bc she is ethiopian and i have not seen her dress traditionally in a long time... She still talkes to me, but she plays [minecraft](https://youtu.be/K4vtrzcqyg0?si=Bc-Alnd9YbOu90In) and communicates differnt from other girls

Look, I be exploring the foreigns with more power than stars

I'm a very rich chick, on my Nene Leakes
I'm a boss, every move gotta come through me
Murder broads in my minks
May they rest in peace
And I'm still the top chick
Any bitch think I drop dick get higher than Mariah
And she like a five octave
Stop it, please stop it
Blowing money
All in Neiman's in there Diddy bopping
And you know I came to murder it
My city watchin'
I'm so humble, I'ma front like I don't do this often

[Classification 31: White Slave Traffic Act](https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/fbi/classifications/031-white-slave-traffic.html) Investigation of white slave traffic is one of the oldest functions of the Bureau, dating from the passage of the White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act) in 1910. Originally established as a separate records system, the white slave traffic act cases were incorporated into the central filing system that the Bureau adopted from the Justice Department in 1921. The act was codified in U.S. Code Title 18 and prohibited transportation of women or girls in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of prostitution, debauchery, or other immoral purposes, the coercion or enticement of women or girls for this purpose, and the coercion or enticement of female minors.


[The Mann Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act), previously called the [White-Slave Traffic Act of 1910](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/25/this-day-in-politics-june-25-1910-663071), is a United States federal law, passed June 25, 1910 (ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825; codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421–2424). It is named after Congressman James Robert Mann of Illinois.



In its original form, the act made it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of "any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and human trafficking, particularly where trafficking was for the purposes of prostitution. It was one of several acts of protective legislation aimed at moral reform during the Progressive Era. In practice, its ambiguous language about "immorality" resulted in it being used to criminalize even consensual sexual behavior between adults.[1] It was amended by Congress in 1978 and again in 1986 to limit its application to transport for the purpose of prostitution or other illegal sexual acts [Editorial: Mayor Bass vetoed a police discipline ballot measure.

California-Compliant AR-15 Rifle?
Not known as a hotbed for firearms freedom, California is home to some of the country's most restrictive gun laws. Still, resident enthusiasts have options for owning a semiautomatic AR-15 if they are willing to procure a state-compliant model following the fixed-magazine or featureless rifle regulations.

## Proposition 64: The Adult Use of Marijuana Act
Overview [The California Cannabis Hemp Initiative of 2014](https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/2014/140072.aspx)
Effective November 9, 2016, Proposition 64 legalizes specified personal use and cultivation of marijuana for adults 21 years of age or older; reduces criminal penalties for specified marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles; and authorizes resentencing or dismissal and sealing of prior, eligible marijuana-related convictions. The proposition includes provisions on regulation, licensing, and taxation of legalized use.

[Frank Lloyd Wright Sr.](https://franklloydwright.org/) (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator. He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and mentoring hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship.[1][2] Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture.

The surreptitious nature of child sex trafficking, with offenders keeping children on the move and crossing jurisdictional lines, makes it difficult to locate and protect children and track down those who exploit them. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) takes a data-centric approach that empowers cross-agency collaboration.

Divide and rule policy (Latin: divide et impera), or divide and conquer, in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power divisively. This includes the exploitation of existing divisions within a political group by its political opponents, and also the deliberate creation or strengthening of such divisions.

The strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of Aulus Gabinius exists, parting the Jewish nation into five conventions, reported by Flavius Josephus in Book I, 169–170 of The Jewish War (De bello Judaico).[1] Strabo also reports in Geographica, 8.7.3[2] that the Achaean League was gradually dissolved when it became part of the Roman province of Macedonia, as the Romans treated the various states differently, wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.[citation needed]

Elements of this technique involve: [citation needed]

creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign and distributing forces so that they overpower each other.
aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign
fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers
encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending [Read<oreOnWikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule) [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173769/)
