## Miki Howard
Hi i was in a household in Savannah georgia and you were a big topic of discussion among the men. Im in a relationship with a Girl I met at Dance411 while i was doing catchwork in atlanta at shitty companies. My household mom name was Vickye_Lynn_Maxwell. She was Married to a man named Willie Kelly JR. He may not like this but she was fully enabled with property and inheritances and died b4 him and he moved another woman in. I am islamic so [im still learning the ropes of multiple relationships in the real word](https://youtu.be/0lMNMwTB5M8?si=B3GG6RPVq3zFTccg) OF DYNAMIC LIFE AND HOW I CAN BE A HEALTHY HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD! In this song you compliment a man who cares for his own nest. One of the girls I got involved wit to the point, her voince is changing and im losing the ability to talk is [Normani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHS9gu-RZGQ). I dont know where The realtionship is headed but I was looking for a partner after [my wife Erika Kelly Abandoned me with a NicuChild](https://www.essence.com/news/erika-renee-johnson-kelly-found-georgia/) And Normani stepped in. I cant stick to JehovahWitness relationship values bc i have children and i dont want them hating the other moms. 

Anyway your romantic life was a specticle in savannah. [KashDoll](https://soundcloud.com/kashdoll/no-lames-feat-summer-walker) told me about " The Pretty Things". Like there is a class of human culture women of the porcilen life know about. I saw Jada outdoors rough oneday so I know you guys are dirty and clean and the album covers are just... Art. Advertisment for some ppl. Im being tortureed by the people that thknn im dirty and lie about me working for [NAsa](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), im not educated, like a lot of things and im scared bc the pretty thing is processing. I worked in InfoTech and only talked to my team an was a JEhovahWitnessPioneer so i am green with people. Im Sure Tracy MAck could help you understand. I sure need her!

# About Kash Doll and Me
NasaJPL, I dont know what she is going by at the moment but she is my post erika wife forever girlfriend surrounding that. The name I was given origionally was Vanessa Walker. We were little kids here from africa that got kidnapped and moved east. She is still in some sort of human trafficking situation. To me she is a really important person and as some of you know my energy towards those in [UpperUnix] administration know how i look up to you. Its isolated bc im learning from you. She is similar. But she has a lot of identities and worst case I want you guys to know i never did any fruad with her. But know thats whats required of her. The character Normani, looks like an attempt for the girls to substitute for each other bc i still get her confused with Erika when she has the [LightComplexion](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5aac18d09fe2d82be24601a8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Brat%20Mail%20Kash%20Doll.jpg) bc they share similar features. Im also afraid bc she is ethiopian and i have not seen her dress traditionally in a long time... She still talkes to me, but she plays [minecraft](https://youtu.be/K4vtrzcqyg0?si=Bc-Alnd9YbOu90In) and communicates differnt from other girls

{% highlight ruby %} 
[Verse]
Look, I be exploring the foreigns with more power than stars
On my new new shit, like my name is Rashaad
And my punchlines seasoned plenty minds like it's time
So, if he ever tell you he ain't feelin' me, he lying'
Shout out to me, all on BET
I'm a very rich chick, on my Nene Leakes
I'm a boss, every move gotta come through me
Murder broads in my minks
May they rest in peace
And I'm still the top chick
Any bitch think I drop dick get higher than Mariah
And she like a five octave
Stop it, please stop it
Blowing money
All in Neiman's in there Diddy bopping
And you know I came to murder it
My city watchin'
I'm so humble, I'ma front like I don't do this often
It's Kash Doll, bow down, and kiss the ring
Soon as this paperwork done
I'm touching everything
A murder scene

[Outro]
Haha
Yeah, that way
The doll way

![Lunar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/LTSS_E_Boxart.jpg) Lunar: The Silver Star[b] is a role-playing video game developed by Game Arts in association with Studio Alex for the Sega/Mega-CD, originally published by Game Arts and released in Japan in 1992. After a successful release, the game was translated and localized by Working Designs for release in North America the following year.

Designed as a “different kind of RPG”,[1] Lunar: The Silver Star made use of the up-and-coming CD-ROM format by featuring high quality audio, full motion video, and voice acting to narrate a fantasy story set in a magical world. The game centers on the exploits of Alex, a young boy from a small town who dreams of one day becoming a great hero like his idol, Dragonmaster Dyne. When a childish adventure later turns to discovering an ancient dragon, Alex and his friends must journey across the world to gather the necessary power to become the next Dragonmaster, and save the world in the process.

Lunar: The Silver Star was critically and commercially successful, becoming the number one selling Mega-CD title in Japan and the second highest-selling Mega-CD title. As the first game in the Lunar series, it set the standard for other follow-up titles including the direct sequel Lunar: Eternal Blue in 1994. Since the game’s original release, three enhanced remakes have been produced for various systems: Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete in 1996, Lunar Legend in 2002, and Lunar: Silver Star Harmony in 2009. wIKIpedia rpgFan SegaRetro Try Lunar if You cant get your emulator right on your celly

### WHAT HiView DOES
HiView is a data explorer and image viewing application supporting the [JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/) image format ![HiVeiw](https://www.uahirise.org/hiview/images/main-splash-screen.jpg) HiView is the best way to explore HiRISE images of the Martian surface at the full resolution of the imagery. Tracks of boulders that have fallen down crater walls, delicate rays of ejecta from fresh impact craters, and the unearthly formations created by carbon dioxide ice on the Martian south pole are just a few of the things that are waiting to be discovered by anyone using a tool like HiView with HiRISE imagery.

"Respiration" is a song by American rappers Mos Def and Talib Kweli, collectively known as Black Star. It was released as the second single from the duo’s eponymously titled 1998 album (see 1998 in music). It features a guest verse from fellow American rapper Common and guitar playing by DeChown Jenkins. The song’s production was handled by Hi-Tek, who sampled "The Fox" as performed by Don Randi. In addition, the song's introduction samples a monologue from the hip hop documentary Style Wars. It is found on Best of Decade I: 1995-2005, a compilation of Rawkus Records' best songs. It can also be found on Howie B's compilation album Another Late Night: Howie B. The single reached #54 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[Talk About it on WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Respiration_(song)) [GeniUs dOt cOm](https://genius.com/Black-star-respiration-lyrics)

[ITC Benguiat is a decorative serif typeface designed by Ed Benguiat and released by the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) in 1977.](https://www.linotype.com/576/itc-benguiat-family.html) The face is loosely based upon typefaces of the Art Nouveau period but is not considered an academic revival. The face follows ITC's design formulary of an extremely high x-height, combined with multiple widths and weights. The original version of 1977 contained numerous nonstandard ligatures (such as AB, AE, AH, AK, AR, LA, SS, TT) and alternate shapes for some letters which were not carried into the digital version. - TAKEN_FRON_WiKiPEDiA
